  <h2>Greeting:</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm a self-taught junior web developer with a passion for learning. I love board games and computer games, but my true passion is exploring how things work. I'm excited to join a team where I can continue to grow my skills and learn from experienced professionals in the industry.</p>
  
  <h2>About my skills:</h2>
  <p>Although I am a junior web developer, I have experience with a variety of tools and technologies, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Python</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I am also familiar with AI technologies such as ChatGPT and have a basic understanding of Linux and MongoDB. While I have been fortunate enough to gain experience with these tools, I recognize that there is still so much to learn in this ever-evolving field. I am excited to continue to learn and grow my skills as a developer.</p>
